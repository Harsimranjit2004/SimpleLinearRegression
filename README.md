## Introduction

The "Introduction" section of the Streamlit app provides an overview of linear regression, including its definition, types, and implementation using libraries such as Scikit-learn. It also includes visual aids and code snippets to aid understanding.

## Live Demo

In the "Live Demo" section, users can upload their dataset or use a provided dataset to perform linear regression analysis. The app allows users to visualize the data, train a linear regression model, evaluate its performance, and download the trained model and predictions.

## Detailed Theory

The "Detailed Theory" section dives deeper into the mathematical concepts behind simple linear regression. It covers topics such as the ordinary least squares method, error functions, and the derivation of the regression coefficients.

## Usage

To launch the Streamlit app, execute the following command in your terminal:

```
streamlit run SimpleLinear.py
```
